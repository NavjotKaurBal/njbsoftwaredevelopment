As we all know every project has different kind of  risks so for my project I also have to ready to face the following risks

**Technology risks**

As technology is being advanced very fast during the development period there are chances that somebody else will be making same project by using more advanced features for that project

**Market risks**

After the completion of my project it depends upon the people will they like my project or not or they will get more attracted towards the other similar projects which are already exist or being made my other organizations people.

**Production risks**

There is a possibility of low production because of the lack of great programming knowledge stuff

**Technical risks**

Sometimes software development firms reduce the functionality of the software because of low budget and there are chances of happening of this risk with my project as well. 

**Unavoidable risks**

As my venture is creating a face reader software so it might concern with personâ€™s personal information so its important to get the permission from government to legally make visible the project for social use.
