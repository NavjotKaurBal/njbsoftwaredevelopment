**Approach Strategic**

As we all know there are basically four common types of strategies, for our project we will use the low cost strategy. We will follow this strategy because the main motive of our project is to provide something new by adding new features into android mobile phones to users but not by increasing the price of mobile phones. If we will do any changes into its prices than definitely its sales will be effected that we don’t want.

**Strategy that could be circulated to my employees and allies**

According to me the best way to interact employees and allies to work within your project is to 

	Explain the plan of your project.

	Provide proper documentation of your project

	Describe how it is different from other projects.

	How it is beneficial in future.
