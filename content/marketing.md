After developing the software this is very important that how you will deliver it to customers or user, how they will know about your product. So in these days, the most popular way to launch your product is social media such as internet, newspaper, TV and radio. This is the best way because peoples always connected with the social media to get the daily updates. So I will use the Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and advertisements to launch my software.

 I will convey the proper information like how this will be used, how it works and what you have to do to star it. I will provide short videos in which I will visually display that how it works; people learn easily from videos. One thing that I will keep in mind that the information that I am providing to users should be real not fake because customers trust you so nobody have a right to break their trust.
